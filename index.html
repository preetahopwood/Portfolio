      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am a designer with a strong computer science leaning. I believe that
      design is meant to communicate a message or the complexities of a system
      in a way that is easy to digest.<br><br>
      I graduated from Northeastern University with a degree in Design,
      concentration in Interactive design, and minor in Computer Science.
      I'm currently based in Portland, Oregon and I prefer to go by they/them
      pronouns, but any are fine.</p>

    <div id="styleContent">
      <h2>Style</h2>
      <p>My style is defined by texture and contrast. I find that implementing
      even a subtle texture warms up the feeling of a piece drastically and can
      contribute to cohesion. I use off-white and off-black colors to decrease
      sterility which I find critical inthe  digital medium. Contrast is
      important not only for legibility's sake but also to
      draw the eye. I often use a single warm pop color that contrasts against
      cooler colors (see this website's color palette).

    <div id="genresContent">
      <h2>Genres</h2>
      <p>As someone who straddles the line between computer science and design,
      there are various types of projects on my website: digital, print, and video<br><br>

      For the first, look at the mobile app Savvy Scorekeeper and the process for this
      website. My experience with print design is primarily shown with my time at
      the Patriot Ledger, though the Stay Cool campaign features physical design
      more broadly. For video, I would showcase my Aliens Animation. Additionally,
      the Odds and Ends category shows a mix of all three types with small projects.
