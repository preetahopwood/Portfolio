            <p><span class="orange">&#9658;</span>Based on an edited TEDtalk, this
            animation features storytelling, afterEffects, and a vector art style.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <p>Originally worked on with a team of four, I continued to revise and
            remake the sections that I had less of a part in after the conclusion of
            the project. I was in charge of most of the storyboard, sound editing,
            some asset creation, and much of the afterEffects animation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>We chose to use vector illustrations because much of our planned
            animation would use text and infographic visuals. In terms color and form,
            we decided that humans were to be represented by warmer colors and geometric
            shapes, while aliens were to have a green-blue palette with organic designs.</p>
            <p>When storyboarding, we wanted cohesive transitions and dynamic
            compositions. An interesting point in the process was using the rotation
            like parenthesis, where we start off in current times, rotate into an aside
            about aliens, then rotate back to the future.</p>

            <h3>First Revision</h3>
            <p>I liked the basic structure of the animation, but had problems with
            stylistic cohesion between different asset creators, the low contrast
            of colors, and the roughness of many transitions. Additionally, I wanted
            to revise the scientist sequence as it was far more static than the rest
            of the piece.</p>
            <p>I first started by updating the background assets so that they had
            more detail and cohesion. This was followed by the rest of the assets,
            aside from the handful I had created. The assets that had the largest
            change were the alien structures, as I redesigned them with a underwater
            theme. While I did so, I simplified the animation structures and fixed
            some of the bad transitions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <h3>Second Revision</h3>
            <p>For my second pass, I solidified a color palette and added gradient
            shading to assets. For many of the backgrounds, I added more detailed
            land to avoid flat planes as well as a change from night to day that
            spans the entire animation.</p>
