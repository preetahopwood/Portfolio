            <h3>Components</h3>
            <p>The campaign has 4 aspects to it: the Oasis, water bottles, posters,
            and animated tips</p>
            <p><span>Oasis:</span> These pop-up structures are designed to fit two street parking spaces.
            It is split into two sections. One half is a green area and the other
            is meant to be a recovery area for when one has a heat stroke.
            </p>
            <p><span>Water Bottles:</span> These bottles will be handed out in high-commuting areas - primarily
            T and Commuter Rail stations. The location will give access to working
            people during a situation where it is typically hot and muggy.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div id="column2">
          <div class="bodyText">
            <p><span>Posters:</span> These posters will be placed around bus stops, T stations, and neighborhoods
              where oasis pop-ups will be located. The oasis posters will have directions
              to the nearest oasis while the water station posters will have a static list of
              locations of the water stations.
            </p>
            <p><span>Tips:</span> A series of videos that visualize tips to deal with heatwaves. They
            are designed for digital billboards, but can also be shown on social media.
            </p>
          </div>

            <h3>Style and Feel</h3>
            <p>My philosophy for style was to have the campaign feel friendly and
            refreshing. On that note, I wanted to use rounded clean shapes
            which were inspired by waterlines when a camera is half-submerged. As
            for color palette, I went for various shades of blues, leaning toward
            green. While the blue is an obvious choice, I leant towards green in
            order to have more luminance as I find purple-blues to be
            too stiff and dark. Accenting this is an occasional light yellow,
            which breaks up the blues when needed.
