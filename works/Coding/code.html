            <p><span class="orange">&#9658;</span>This website is coded and designed
            by myself. It is hosted on Amazon's web services and uses Javascript,
            HTML, and CSS.</p>

            <p>My website has been a project spanning ever since I started learning
            html. It has been a place to experiment with new code and different
            styles.

            <h3>Initial</h3>
            <p>The initial version was made around 4 years ago when I first learned
            HTML. It featured white backgrounds and an Instagram-like layout. Detail
            pages were a single image and long sections of text. Unfortunately,
            much of this version has been lost to time. I was able to find an initial
            homepage sketch and a detail page.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <h3>Purple</h3>
            <p>I did a major redesign a little after graduating. It featured the
            same illustrations as what is currently on the website, but instead of gray
            I used bright purple. This had some obvious downsides, but I did somewhat
            enjoy the color combination of purple and orange.</p>
            <p>The layout of this design was slightly different than is what is
            currently used; it used a navigation bar, the work page links were more
            contained, and detail pages featured a more column-based layout with
            images on the right and small paragraphs on the left. This version
            also didn't use Javascript, with the exception of the third-party carousel
            called Flickity.</p>

        <div id="column2">
          <div class="bodyText">
            <p>This also included a significant change in what works I was showing.
            Instead of a single poster, a 3D model, and 3D printed object, I had
            the Stalwart typeface(now in Odds and Ends), Stay Cool, the Patriot
            Ledger, and Simply Score(now called Savvy Scorekeeper)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <h3>To Gray</h3>
            <p>In this redesign stage, I finally changed the eyesore purple with
            the dark gray that is still used now. With that, I changed my portrait
            from the purple-based one that existed previously. Also changed is
            my addition of Animation and Odds and Ends to the work page. Odds and
            Ends has kept it's purpose, but Animation previously contained Aliens
            as well as two other smaller animations.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="bodyText">
            <h3>The Latest Design</h3>
            <p>When I refreshed my knowledge of Javascript, I decided to do a new
            design for my portfolio. Notable additions consisted of an introduction on the
            home page, self-coded carousels, and the Works page's redesign.
            Throughout the website is a commitment to the gray palette, with
            the off-white becoming the color for text.</p>
            <p>A priority for this change was to reduce load times for the project
            detail pages. With that, I lessened the amount of images on this page,
            enlarged them, and put all additional images to a page attached to the
            detail page. While examining my projects, I demoted some projects into the Odds
            and ends section as well as promoting the Aliens Animation and the
            Portfolio Website.</p>
